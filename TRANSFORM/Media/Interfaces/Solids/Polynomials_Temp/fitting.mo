<p>
Polynomials.fitting(u,y,n) computes the coefficients of a polynomial
p(u) of degree \"n\" that fits the data \"p(u[i]) - y[i]\"
in a least squares sense. The polynomial is
returned as a vector p[n+1] that has the following definition:

<pre>
  p(u) = p[1]*u^n + p[2]*u^(n-1) + ... + p[n]*u + p[n+1];
