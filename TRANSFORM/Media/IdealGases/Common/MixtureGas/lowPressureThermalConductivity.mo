<p>
This function applies the Masson and Saxena modification of the
Wassiljewa Equation for the thermal conductivity for gas mixtures of
n elements at low pressure.
</p>

<p>
For nonpolar gas mixtures errors will generally be less than 3 to 4%.
For mixtures of nonpolar-polar and polar-polar gases, errors greater
than 5 to 8% may be expected. For mixtures in which the sizes and
polarities of the constituent molecules are not greatly different, the
thermal conductivity can be estimated satisfactorily by a mole fraction
average of the pure component conductivities.
